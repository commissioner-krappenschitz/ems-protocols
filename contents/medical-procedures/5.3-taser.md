# 5.3 - Taser

State and local law enforcement may use a conductive energy weapon called a Taser. This device is a non- lethal tool. When used, the device discharges a wire that, at the distal end, contains an arrow-like barbed projectile that penetrates the suspect’s skin and embeds itself, allowing a 5- second incapacitating electric shock. Current medical literature does not support routine medical evaluation for an individual after Taser application. In most circumstances’ probes can be removed by law enforcement without further medical intervention.
