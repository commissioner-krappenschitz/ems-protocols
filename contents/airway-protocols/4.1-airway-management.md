# 4.1 - Airway Management

{% hint style="info" %}
The goal of good airway management is good gas exchange.

{% tab title="Assessment" %}
* Each patient presents unique problems that cannot be fully outlined in any algorithm. As such, the provider must rely on thorough assessment techniques and consider each of the following:
  * Airway Patency: Assess for airway obstruction or risk of impending obstruction due to facial injuries, mass, foreign body, swelling, etc
    * Assess for presence/absence of gag reflex.
    * Assess for use of non rebreather mask or nasal cannula
  * Oxygen: Used to help patients pulse increase or decrease if hyperventilating.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Basic Skills" %}
* Mastery of basic airway skills is paramount to the successful management of a patient with respiratory compromise. Ensure a patent airway with the use of:
  * Chin-lift/jaw-thrust
  * Nasal airway (can be used in combination with oral airways, use with caution if suspected facial fractures)
  * Oral airway (can be used in combination with nasal airways)
  * Suction
  * Removal of foreign body
