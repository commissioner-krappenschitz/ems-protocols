# 3.5 - Spinal Trauma

{% hint style="info" %}
**Purpose:** This protocol provides guidance regarding the assessment and care of patients who have a possible spinal injury.

Patients who have experienced a mechanism of spinal injury (esp. high-risk mechanisms. See Red Flag Box.) require spinal motion restriction (as described further on) and protection of the injury site if they exhibit:

* Midline spinal pain or tenderness with palpation.
* Abnormal (i.e., not baseline) neurological function or motor strength in any extremity.&#x20;
* Numbness or tingling (paresthesia).
* Sensation is not intact and symmetrical (or baseline for patient).
* Cervical flexion, extension and rotation elicits midline spinal pain.

Or if they cannot competently participate in the assessment due to one of the following:

* Altered mental status (e.g., dementia, preexisting brain injury, developmental delay, psychosis).
* Alcohol or drug intoxication.
* Unable to participate in assessment (e.g., distracted by significant injuries to self or others).
* Insurmountable communication barriers (e.g. deafness, or hard of hearing, language).

Patients without any of the above findings should generally be transported without the use of a cervical collar or other means to restrict spinal motion. Utilize spinal motion restriction only where, in the professional judgement of the provider, the patient is at high risk for spinal injury as described above or with clear clinical indications of injury (e.g., midline spinal pain or deformity of the spine.)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Long backboards do not have a role for patients being transported between facilities. If the sending facility has the patient on a long backboard or is aking EMS to use a long backboard for transport, EMS providers should discuss not using a long backboard with the sending facility physician before transporting a patient.
