# 6.5 - Mass Casualty Triage

A multiple casualty incident (MCI) is any situation where the number of sick or injured patients exceeds the available local, regional, or state EMS system resources to provide adequate care in a timely manner to minimize injury and death. An MCI may be the result of a manmade disaster or a natural event.

**Purpose:**

* The goal of the Mass/Multiple Casualty Triage protocol is to prepare for a unified, coordinated, and immediate EMS mutual aid response by prehospital and hospital agencies to effectively expedite the emergency management of the victims of any type of MCI.
* Successful management of any MCI depends upon the effective cooperation, organization, and planning among health care professionals, hospital administrators and out-of-hospital EMS agencies, state and local government representatives, and individuals and/or organizations associated with disaster-related support agencies.

**EMS Provider Role:**

* All providers must have thorough knowledge of both the Incident Command System (ICS) and the triage system.
* Within the scope of the MCI, the EMS provider may perform procedures within their scope of practice.

**Scene Assessment and Triage Priorities:**

1. The initial response team should assess the scene for potential hazards, safety, and number of victims to determine the appropriate level of response.
2. Notify agency dispatch to declare an MCI and need for interagency support as defined by incident level. Agency dispatch should coordinate requests for additional resources and contact local mutual aid, regional and state level agencies for assistance and notification as needed.
3. Identify and designate the following positions as qualified personnel become available: EMS Command responsible for overall command of all EMS resources and tactics; Triage Officer responsible for overseeing all triage group activities; Treatment Officer responsible for overseeing all treatment group activities; Staging Officer responsible for overseeing staging of all arriving ambulances and other mobile EMS resources; Loading Officer responsible for overseeing loading of all treated patients into ambulances, buses, and helicopters and logging patient information, tag numbers and coordinating hospital destinations.
4. Identify and designate EMS sector areas of MCI including Triage, Treatment, Staging and Loading.

**Triage Process:**

Utilize a triage system such as “SALT” (Sort, Assess, Lifesaving Interventions, Treatment/ Transport) to prioritize patients.

* Assess each patient as quickly as possible.
* Conduct rapid assessment.
* Assign patients to broad categories based on need for treatment (Still, Wave, Walk).
* Remember: Triage is not treatment! Stopping to provide care to one patient will only delay care for others. Standard triage care is only to correct airway and severe bleeding problems.
