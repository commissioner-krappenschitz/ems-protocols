# 6.3 - Police Custody

**Purpose**

* The purpose of this policy is to give EMS guidance for patients who are in police custody, restrained, and/or protective custody is required.

**Protective Custody**

* Protective custody is a civil status in which an incapacitated person is detained by a peace officer for the purposes of:
  * Assuring the safety of the individual or the public or both; and
  * Assisting the individual to return to a functional condition.

**Police Custody**

* Police custody for this policy, shall mean a person under arrest.
* Patients who EMS believe require medical care should be transported to a medical facility. If police and EMS disagree about whether a patient in police custody requires transport to a medical facility for further assessment or treatment, on-line medical control must be contacted, and a law enforcement supervisor should be requested for guidance.

**EMS Initiated Restraints**

* For any patient potentially requiring restraints by EMS, see 5.3 - Restraints Protocol

**Police Restraint Devices**

* Patients transported by EMS who have been restrained by law enforcement devices (e.g., handcuffs) should be accompanied, in the patient compartment, by a law enforcement officer who can remove the device. If this is not feasible, the officer MUST follow directly behind the transporting ambulance to the receiving hospital.

**TasersÂ® (Conductive Electrical Weapon)**

* Patients who have been subdued by a Taser device, see 5.4 - Taser Protocol
